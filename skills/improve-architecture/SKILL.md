# Improve Architecture: Review and Improve Code Architecture

🥷 Periodically clean design debt, keep code healthy.

## Outcome Contract

- **Outcome**: Architecture improvement report with findings, priorities, and PRD alignment analysis
- **Done when**: All PRDs scanned, codebase analyzed, findings categorized with priorities and effort estimates
- **Evidence**: Collected code patterns, PRD analysis, architecture alignment assessment
- **Output**: Structured report with blocking/high/medium priority findings

## Prerequisites

Read available domain context before starting. If any are missing, proceed without them and note the limitation in the report:

- `CONTEXT.md` — domain glossary (if missing: scan code naming conventions instead)
- `docs/adr/` — architecture decisions (if missing: no historical decisions to check against)
- `docs/prd/*.md` — product requirements (if missing: report focuses on code patterns only, no PRD alignment analysis)

## Process Summary

**Step 1**: Apply the [Skill Entry Protocol](../rules/entry-protocol.md) — it reads CONTEXT.md, ADRs, and PRDs. Code-level signals (duplication, coupling, long functions) don't strictly require domain context, so proceed even if docs are missing.

**Step 2**: Analyze current development direction — extract planned features, check compatibility with existing architecture

**Step 3**: Scan codebase using prioritized strategy — PRD-linked modules first, high-change-frequency modules next, cross-cutting concerns last. For each module, apply the objective detection heuristics in [REFERENCE.md §Design Debt Signals](REFERENCE.md) (code duplication, long functions, tight coupling, global state, leaked/missing abstractions, shallow modules, god objects — each with a concrete grep/line-count threshold). Run the ADR compliance check (REFERENCE §3.3) against each ADR in `docs/adr/`.

**Step 4**: Analyze findings — categorize as blocking/high priority/medium priority with PRD links. Each finding must have specific location, evidence, and impact.

**Step 5**: Propose improvements — problem, suggestion, benefit, effort (Low/Medium/High with rationale), linked PRD

**Step 6**: Generate report — structured findings with next steps

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for scanning strategy, detection heuristics, ADR compliance procedure, and extended examples.

## Gotchas

| What happened | Rule |
|---|---|
| Modify working code without verifying | Read and understand code before suggesting |
| Rename without improving structure | Deepen modules, don't just rename |
| Change too much at once | Small improvements, one at a time |
| Ignore domain language | Name based on CONTEXT.md terms |
| Violate historical ADR | Check ADRs, create new ADR if needed |
| Ignore PRD constraints | Check if improvement aligns with planned features |
| Introduce new concept without updating | Sync update to CONTEXT.md |

## Output

```
Improve Architecture complete.

Scan scope:       [PRDs: N, Code files: N, ADRs: N]
Alignment:        [✅ N, ⚠️ N, ❌ N]
Findings:         [Blocking: N, High: N, Medium: N]

Next: Review blocking issues → /story to decompose → /tdd to implement
```

**PRD Traceability:** If findings link to a PRD, fill the `Arch reviewed by` field:
```markdown
- **Arch reviewed by**: `/improve-architecture` (<YYYY-MM-DD>) — <one-line finding + priority>
```

## Workflow Position

**Independent periodic activity**, not in main development flow:

```
New feature dev: think → grill → story → tdd → review
Bug fix: debug
Independent periodic: improve-architecture (every 2-4 weeks)
```
