# Research: Authoritative Technical Investigation, Persisted

🥷 Research once, reuse forever — but only from sources that actually know.

A research record is a **durable note capturing best practice for one stack × topic × major-version**, sourced exclusively from authoritative sources. It lives in `docs/research/` so the next skill — notably `/think` Step 5 — can query `INDEX.md` and reuse the TL;DR instead of re-searching. This sits beside `/grill` (domain glossary `CONTEXT.md`): grill curates *project domain language*; research curates *external technical best practice*.

## Outcome Contract

- **Outcome**: One immutable research record (`docs/research/<stack>-<topic>-<major>.md`) plus an updated `INDEX.md` row, both grounded in authoritative sources. On a query miss, the record answers the question; on a hit, this skill may mark `stale` instead of duplicating.
- **Done when**: The record is written with a Tier 1 primary source, TL;DR at top, all six sections filled, INDEX updated, and any older-major sibling left untouched.
- **Evidence**: The record file runs as a standalone Markdown doc; its `## Sources` lists at least one directly-accessible authoritative URL; INDEX gains a row linking to it.
- **Output**: Stack, topic, major, verdict (TL;DR), file path, INDEX row added, source tier summary.

## Core Principles

1. **Authoritative sources only** — every verdict needs at least one **Tier 1** source (official docs, official source, official spec) as primary evidence. Tier 2 (accepted RFCs, changelogs, maintainer-flagged comments) only supplements; never solely supports a verdict. Non-authoritative sources are excluded, not "demoted". See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).
2. **Immutable records** — once written, a record is frozen as the truth *for that major version*. A new major creates a new file (`-18.md` → `-19.md`); the old one is never edited. Historical traceability is the point. See ADR-0004.
3. **Version-aware** — every record carries `stack@version`; the filename carries the major. Stale detection compares against the project's current dependency manifest, not against time.
4. **Query before re-searching** — before creating a new record, query `INDEX.md` for an existing one. A hit means reuse (or mark stale); only a miss starts new research.
5. **Lazy creation** — `docs/research/` and `INDEX.md` are created on first research output, never scaffolded empty. Mirrors `docs/prd/` and `docs/adr/` lazy-creation convention.

## Process Summary

**Step 0 — Bootstrap.** Apply the [Skill Entry Protocol](../rules/entry-protocol.md) to locate domain docs and read `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` (reuse validated terminology and decisions; don't re-derive). Also read `docs/research/INDEX.md` if it exists. State what's missing.

**Step 1 — State the question.** Write down the one question being answered (stack + topic + target major) in one sentence. Confirm the **stack** is a leaf unit (not a composite like `react-nextjs`) and the **topic** is narrow enough for a single one-line verdict (if its answer needs a branching matrix, split it). See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the granularity test.

**Step 2 — Query INDEX first (dedup).** Before researching, scan `docs/research/INDEX.md` for an existing record matching `stack + topic + major`. If found, this is a candidate collision — ask the user whether to **resume/reuse** the existing record or create a new one with a distinct topic. Mirrors Entry Protocol Step 3a and anti-pattern #40. On a hit at a *different* major, treat as reuse of that sibling, not a duplicate.

**Step 3 — Detect current version.** Read the project's dependency manifest (`package.json` / `go.mod` / `Cargo.toml` / `requirements.txt` / `pom.xml` etc.) to find the stack's current version. If multiple majors coexist (monorepo), each major gets its own record. If no manifest is readable, set `stack@version=unknown` and skip stale checks.

**Step 4 — Gather authoritative sources.** Research against **Tier 1** (official docs / source / spec). Supplement with **Tier 2** (accepted RFCs, changelogs, maintainer-flagged comments). Reject non-authoritative sources entirely — blogs, tutorials, SO, community-maintained sites, unaccepted RFC drafts, AI-generated content. Every source needs a directly-accessible URL to the specific page. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the source-tier checklist.

**Step 5 — Write the record.** Create `docs/research/<stack>-<topic>-<major>.md` from the [RESEARCH-FORMAT](RESEARCH-FORMAT.md) template: TL;DR + Question + Approach + Findings (comparison matrix) + Verdict & Rationale + Boundary Conditions + Sources. Slug-case stack and topic (lowercase, hyphenated, strip special chars and dots: `C++`→`cpp`, `Node.js`→`nodejs`). **Do not** edit an existing record to "update" it — if the major already has a record, you're at Step 2's collision path.

**Step 6 — Update INDEX.** Append/update a row in `docs/research/INDEX.md` (see [INDEX-FORMAT](INDEX-FORMAT.md)): both the **By Stack** view (grouped per stack) and the **By Topic** view (cross-stack, single-stack rows kept too). Set `Status=verified`, `Version=<stack@full-version>`. Lazy-create INDEX on first record.

**Step 7 — Stale check (collaborative).** While you have INDEX open, compare each existing record's major against the project's current manifest. On a major mismatch, set that row's `Status=stale`, change its `Version` to `studied-version → current-major` (e.g. `react@18.2 → 19`), and append `→ suggest /research <stack> <topic>-<current-major>`. Do **not** auto-trigger re-research — that's the user's call.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the source-tier decision tree, version-detection edge cases, the granularity test with examples, and the authoritative-source identification checklist.

Shared behavioral constraints: apply [../rules/anti-patterns.md](../rules/anti-patterns.md) when a global anti-pattern is relevant.

## Gotchas

| What happened | Rule |
|---|---|
| Cited a blog/tutorial/SO answer as decision evidence | Principle 1: Tier 1 primary source required; non-authoritative sources are excluded, not demoted |
| Edited an existing record to "update" it for a new major | Principle 2 / Step 5: records are immutable — create a new `-<newmajor>.md` file; the old stays frozen as historical truth (ADR-0004) |
| Created a record without checking INDEX first | Step 2: query INDEX for `stack+topic+major` collision before writing; reuse on hit (anti-pattern #40) |
| Built a composite stack slug (`react-nextjs`) | Step 1: stack must be a leaf unit; decompose composites into separate leaf stacks |
| Wrote a topic whose verdict needs a branching matrix | Step 1: too broad — split into narrower topics each answerable by one verdict |
| Dropped the major from the filename (`react-concurrent-rendering.md`) | Step 5: filename is `<stack>-<topic>-<major>.md`; INDEX reads version from the filename |
| Cited an unaccepted RFC draft or community-maintained site (cppreference) | Principle 1: Tier 2 is *accepted/merged* RFCs only; community-but-not-official sites are excluded |
| Source URL points to a homepage, not the specific page | Principle 1 / Step 4: URL must be directly accessible to the specific page proving the claim |
| Auto-triggered re-research when marking stale | Step 7: stale is a hint, not an action — user explicitly runs `/research` to re-research |
| Within-major error "fixed" by silent rewrite | Immutability is across majors; intra-major correction appends a dated, sourced `## Correction` block — never a silent rewrite (ADR-0004) |

## Output

```
Research complete.

Question:  <stack + topic + target major, one sentence>
Stack:     <leaf unit slug, e.g. react>
Topic:     <slug, e.g. concurrent-rendering>
Major:     <e.g. 18>
Current project version: <from manifest, or "unknown — stale checks skipped">

Verdict (TL;DR): <one-line answer + key trade-off>

Record:    docs/research/<stack>-<topic>-<major>.md
INDEX:     row added/updated — Status=verified, Version=<stack@full>
Sources:   <N> Tier 1, <M> Tier 2

Stale sweep (if INDEX existed):
- <stack>-<topic>-<oldmajor>.md → Status=stale, Version=<old> → <current-major> (suggest /research ...)

Next:
- If this research informs a decision: /think (it will query INDEX and reuse the TL;DR)
- If the project adopts the conclusion: /grill to record an ADR referencing this record
```

**PRD/ADR Traceability:** If a PRD or ADR consumes this research, it should reference the record path. PRDs cite it in `## Research References`; ADRs cite it in `## References`. The research record is the *evidence layer*; PRD/ADR are the *decision layer* — they reference, never copy.
